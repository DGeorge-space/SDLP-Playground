# SDLP-Playground

A simple sandbox for learning features of SDL. 

Project is used to generate geometry (squares, circles etc) on to a grid which colours pixels on the screen and applies a simple box blur effect to all objects.

This project in part makes up a wider goal to explore elements related to physics engine design.
